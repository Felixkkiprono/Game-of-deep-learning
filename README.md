# Game-of-deep-learning
This repository is based on the competition Game of Deep learning here(https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/game-of-deep-learning/#problem_statement) is the link to the data .
My solution was based on the fastai library,if you are interested in learning more about it i would suggest taking this https://course.fast.ai/ online free course.
I used google colab to perform the task. It has preinstalled fastai.
